# Running the Project on Gitpod
The convenient method to run this project is to run it over Gitpod as you donâ€™t have to download too
many things on your machine.

To run this project on Gitpod simply add https://gitpod.io/# in front of the github repositry link.

Now we have to setup the gitpod environment to run this project .


For frontend :
Open bash Terminal in your gitpod
Step 1 :- Head over to your frontend folder with the command
cd frontend
Step 2 :- Install npm to run the react setup
npm install
Step 3 :- Install reduxJS to run the Slices created
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
Step 4 :- Install Testing Library React for the react setup
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
If you want to run the tests manually you can run the command
npm test
Step 5 :- We have added tailwind graphics to our project that you need to download using
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
We are done with the frontend part of our project after this.


For backend :
Open bas Terminal in your gitpod
Step 1 :- Headover to the backend folder with the command
cd backend
Step 2 :- Ensure your enviroment is ready with JDK 17 or above if not then install it in your machine
To check java version use java -version
If its lower that Java 17 setup jdk 17 using a .gitpot.Dockerfile and add the given set of
code in that
FROM gitpod/workspace-full
# Install Java 17
RUN sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-17-jdk
# Set Java 17 as the default Java version
RUN sudo update-alternatives --config java
RUN sudo update-alternatives --config javac
Step 3 :- Set java version for maven using and pom.xml file and aplly this code in that file
<build>
<plugins>
<plugin>
<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
<version>3.8.1</version>
<configuration>
<source>17</source>
<target>17</target>
</configuration>
</plugin>
</plugins>
</build>
Step 4 :- Clean and build the project
Clean the project using ./mvnw clean
Install the dependencies using ./mvnw install
Run the application using ./mvnw spring-boot:run
Now we are done with fixing the both frontend and backend environment in our gitpod


To run the overall project at once we need to create 2 terminals where
In Terminal 1 :-
cd frontend
npm start
In Terminal 2 :-
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
These commands will automatically build the whole project into your local browser port.
